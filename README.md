               i.e.:    
               
               *English*           
                hello                 
                lettuce              
                to drink   
                
                *Spanish*
                hola
                lechuga
                beber

Every problem has a word/phrase in either English or another language you have chosen. Each problem has a line that you can use to write the opposite language's translation onto. Copy the result and paste into a Microsoft Word document. You may add your own title/instructions to the worksheet. Print the worksheet.
